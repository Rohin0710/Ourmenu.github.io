                            Stairway to Heaven
                            Led Zeppelin
                            [Verse 1]
                            There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                            When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
                            With a word she can get what she came for
                            Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
                            There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
                            'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
                            In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
                            Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

                            [Chorus]
                            Ooh, makes me wonder
                            Ooh, makes me wonder

                            [Verse 2]
                            There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
                            And my spirit is crying for leaving
                            In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
                            And the voices of those who stand looking

                            [Chorus]
                            Ooh, makes me wonder
                            Ooh, really makes me wonder


                            [Verse 3]
                            And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
                            Then the piper will lead us to reason
                            And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
                            And the forests will echo with laughter

                            [Verse 4]
                            If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
                            It's just a spring clean for the May queen
                            Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
                            There's still time to change the road you're on

                            [Chorus]
                            And it makes me wonder
                            Ohhhh, woah

                            [Verse 5]
                            Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
                            The piper's calling you to join him
                            Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
                            Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

                            [Guitar Solo]

                            [Bridge]
                            And as we wind on down the road
                            Our shadows taller than our soul
                            There walks a lady we all know
                            Who shines white light and wants to show
                            How everything still turns to gold
                            And if you listen very hard
                            The tune will come to you at last
                            When all are one and one is all
                            To be a rock and not to roll


                            [Outro]
                            And she's buying a stairway to heaven

                            [I. The House Of Mirrors]

                            Listen to the tale I tell
                            A haunting dream I know so well
                            When walking home alone one night
                            My path revealed by candlelight
                            Ahead I see an open door
                            With no idea what's in store
                            I glance inside the door to see
                            A hall of mirrors beckons me
                            I take a breath and step inside
                            A tale of love and shattered pride
                            The door slams shut, I start to run
                            And it seems my journey has begun...

                            I run and turn from side to side
                            With fear and panic in my eyes
                            The vastness overwhelming me
                            Mirrors far as the eye can see
                            I see myself in every one
                            I see the things that I have done
                            A thousand forms of flattery
                            The fear soon turns to haughtiness in me

                            Different mirrors, different shapes
                            My different strengths accentuate
                            Each mirror has a name and face
                            And all reflect me in some way
                            I look at them to see myself
                            To judge my life by someone else
                            The metaphors within replete:
                            The mirrors are the people that I met


                            Look at the man you see - in the mirrors
                            The things you can be - in the mirrors
                            The glory of me revealed in the mirror's eye
                            The mirror never lies
                            The fire in my eyes - in the mirrors
                            The vanity rise - in the mirrors
                            The power of pride comes alive in the mirrors

                            Gazing in the mirrors I behold
                            All the greatest chapters of my story ever told
                            In the mirrors
                            The world is turned to gold

                            [Orchestral section]

                            At the end of the Hall of Mirrors
                            I behold a golden door
                            I imagine all the beauty
                            The other side must hold in store
                            So I quickly reach out my hand
                            To enter the next room in this promised land
                            I pull the giant door open
                            To continue my journey, I step inside
                            But it slams shut behind me, and I'm back outside
                            The pouring rain welcomes me
                            Into the arms of the coldest, blackest night


                            [II. The Stranger In The Storm]

                            The light of the mirrors has faded away
                            Into distant memory
                            As the rain keeps coming down
                            My candle extinguished
                            I struggle to walk a path I cannot see
                            And the rain keeps coming down

                            The darkness grows with every step
                            I could cut it with a knife
                            As the rain keeps coming down
                            I can't see a thing and I've never felt
                            So alone in all my life
                            But the rain keeps coming down...

                            Caught in the fury of the storm
                            (The darkness suffocates)
                            Body and soul weary and worn
                            (Another twist of fate)
                            Never been so afraid before
                            (The ending of this tale?)
                            Never should have opened the door
                            (From euphoria to hell)

                            I question my fate, my end
                            To die in this storm
                            Maybe this was the plan
                            Back from the day I was born
                            But in the hall of mirrors I had felt so high
                            I cannot walk another mile in this flood
                            So resigned to my fate, I just collapse in the mud
                            If I cannot go on, I'll just lay down and die


                            Suddenly a light I see, shining in the distance
                            I make my way toward it with my fading hope reborn
                            As I draw near, the light is clear
                            Though the rain beats its resistance
                            But I press on and pray this is a shelter from the storm
                            Advancing now toward the light
                            I'm quickly moving forward
                            This hope has given me new strength
                            I thought I'd never know
                            But I take a step, and fall right back
                            For the ground's gone beneath me
                            And I behold, illuminated in the light's warm glow
                            A dark chasm, a great abyss
                            A vast expanse of nothingness
                            A pit that has no bottom as far as the eye can see
                            It spans the whole horizon, and there is no way across
                            My lonely heart is shattered and all hope I had is lost

                            I'm startled to feel a hand on my shoulder
                            I turn to see a shadowed figure standing in the rain
                            But somehow I'm not afraid of him
                            Even when he speaks my name
                            And somehow I can tell that he means me no harm
                            Just by the peace that I see in his eyes
                            And even though I've never even seen him before
                            It's like he's known me all my life
                            "Why are you crying?" the stranger asks
                            As I wipe away the tears
                            I point toward the great abyss
                            The source of all my fears

                            "I must get across and get to that light
                            For it represents my only hope tonight
                            But when I saw the chasm, all that hope was lost
                            I've spent so long in the dark and the rain
                            That the sight of the light made my heart sing again
                            But the gulf's so wide, and there's no way across"

                            The stranger smiled, and took my hand
                            He said, "But you are wrong, my friend
                            You cannot cross the gulf yourself, that's true"
                            He led me down toward the edge
                            And pointed just over the ledge
                            And said, "Behold, I built a bridge for you"

                            [Solo]

                            I cross the bridge toward the light
                            The stranger saved my life tonight
                            I turn to try to thank him, but he's gone
                            A long way to the other side
                            I'll make my way without my guide
                            No time to waste, for I must carry on

                            The bright light shines forth from behind
                            A door beyond description
                            Blood and scratches mark the door from ages of abuse
                            I'm confused no more, for above the door
                            Is a weathered, old inscription
                            "All who would see reality, enter the Hall of Truth"
                            And so I do

                            [III. The Truth Revealed]

                            As I step inside
                            I can see another mirror
                            A mirror so bright
                            That my eyes must turn away
                            A mirror so high
                            I start to question all the others
                            And as I stand there in the Hall of Truth
                            My heart can only say:
                            "Show me the truth, I don't know what to believe
                            For the mirrors all showed something different to me
                            And my pride has given way to misery
                            I've spent so long in the dark and the rain
                            That the sight of the light made my heart sing again
                            And the stranger built a bridge across for me"

                            "BEHOLD THYSELF" a voice rings out
                            In paralyzing thunder
                            It echoes all throughout the hall
                            And sends me to my knees
                            When the voice calls my name
                            I'm overcome with fear and wonder

                            As I slowly start to rise
                            And face the great mirror in front of me
                            When I open my eyes, I have to close them again
                            But still the image is burned into my mind...
                            A face with eyes as black as night
                            A terrifying sight
                            The flesh rotting away in sickness and decay
                            It's mangled by disease
                            I'm unable to breathe
                            Tell me what manner of creature this could be
                            'Cause it's not me

                            I run away as fast as my feet will carry me
                            Back to the door leading into the night
                            Even the storm that almost claimed my life
                            Was better than this
                            And so I throw open the door and see a man
                            (The figure of a man)
                            The stranger from the storm returns again
                            (To save me once again?)
                            I see understanding in his eyes
                            (He's seen this all before)
                            Maybe he can tell me what I saw behind that door

                            "Tell me what I saw in the mirror
                            Before I ran away
                            Tell me what I saw in the mirror
                            That face of sickness and decay
                            Tell me what I saw in the mirror
                            That left me terrorized
                            With the lifeless, blackened eyes?
                            Was it a demon
                            From the fiery waves?
                            Was it the undead
                            From beyond the grave?
                            Oh the face that I beheld in the mirror
                            Left me paralyzed
                            Won't you tell me what I saw
                            In the mirror on this night?"

                            "The light from the mirror you saw from afar
                            The Mirror of Souls shows all men as they are
                            You entered the hall and you asked for the truth
                            The man that you saw in the mirror was you"

                            "No! Don't show me the truth
                            'cause I don't want to believe
                            What the Mirror of Souls
                            Has revealed unto me
                            And the face I saw reflected cannot be me
                            Dying and lost in the arms of decay
                            I do not recognize the face I've seen today
                            And if you say that's my face I must disagree"

                            The meaning of these things I saw:
                            The mirror is the holy eyes of God
                            The truth unveiled before me
                            With these words of the stranger:
                            "The mirrors you saw in the hall long ago
                            Were mirrors of lies, not reflecting the soul
                            When you look unto others to see what they see
                            You see an illusion, deception, false reality"

                            I have seen my soul in the mirror
                            And it has broken me
                            I have seen myself so much clearer
                            Than I had ever seen
                            "Can't you take away all this sickness
                            From my soul and set me free?
                            You can save me...I believe"
                            And then he said, "Arise, my child
                            Your faith has made you reconciled
                            Now gaze into the Mirror once again"
                            We walked together through the door
                            And I looked in the glass once more
                            But the only one reflected back was him
                            Somehow the only one in the mirror saw was him

                            Gazing in the Mirror of my Soul
                            Staring at the man who took my place
                            And made me whole
                            In the Mirror
                            The Mirror of my Soul

                            And Then There Was Silence
                            - Blind Guardian


                            He carries along
                            From a distant place, he's on his way
                            He'll bring decay
                            (Don't move along cause things they will go wrong
                            The end is getting closer day by day)
                            In shades of grey
                            We're doomed to face the night
                            Light's out of sight

                            Since we've reached the point of no return
                            We pray for starlight, we wait for the moon
                            The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
                            We're getting nowhere

                            We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
                            The sacred halls empty and cold
                            The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
                            Revenge will be taken by Rome

                            We live a lie
                            Under the dying moon
                            Pale faced laughs doom
                            Indulges in delight
                            It's getting out of hand
                            The final curtain will fall
                            Hear my voice
                            There is no choice
                            There's no way out
                            You'll find out

                            We don't regret it
                            So many men have failed, but now he's gone
                            Go out and get it
                            The madman's head, it shall be thine
                            We don't regret it
                            That someone else dies hidden in disguise
                            Go out and get it
                            Orion's hound shines bright

                            Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
                            Around the ring
                            Just stop running, running
                            Round the ring
                            Don't you know that fate has been decided
                            By the gods
                            Feel the distance, distance
                            Out of reach

                            Welcome to the end
                            Watch your step, Cassandra, you might fall
                            As I've stumbled on the field
                            Sister mine
                            Find myself in darkest places
                            Find myself drifting away
                            (Death's a certain thing)
                            And the otherworld, the otherworld appears


                            Find myself, she dies in vain
                            Cannot be freed, I'm falling down
                            As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
                            The ferryman will wait for you, my dear

                            And then there was silence
                            Just a voice from the otherworld
                            Like a leaf in an icy world
                            Memories will fade

                            Misty tales and poems lost
                            All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                            May my weary soul find release for a while
                            At the moment of death I will smile
                            It's the triumph of shame and disease
                            In the end
                            Iliad

                            Raise my hands and praise the day
                            Break the spell, show me the way
                            In decay
                            The flame of Troy will shine bright

                            The newborn child would carry ruin to the hall
                            The newborn's death will be a blessing to us all


                            Good choice, bad choice?
                            Out of three you've choosen misery
                            Power and wisdom you deny
                            Bad choice, bad choice
                            War is the only answer
                            When love will conquer fear

                            So the judgment's been made
                            To the fairest, the graceful says
                            Badly he fails

                            (Warning)
                            Fear the heat of passion, father king
                            Don't let him in, don't let her in
                            Desire, lust, obssession, death they'll bring
                            We can't get out once they are in

                            She's like the sunrise
                            Outshines the moon at night
                            Precious like starlight
                            She'll bring in a murderous price

                            In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
                            Jealousy
                            I can clearly see the end now
                            I can clearly see the end now
                            I can clearly see the end now

                            The thread of life is spun
                            The coin's been placed below my tongue
                            Never give up, never give in
                            Be on our side so we can win
                            Never give up, never give in
                            Be on our side

                            Old moon's time is soon to come

                            Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
                            Nothing to lose, like one we'll stand
                            We'll face the storm created by man

                            Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy

                            And as the lion slaughters man
                            I am the wolf and you're the lamb

                            Hallowed Troy shall fall
                            Round the wall
                            Faith is shattered, bodies fall

                            Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
                            Nothing to lose, like one we'll stand
                            It's all for one and one for all
                            All we live for will be wiped out

                            I feel that something's wrong
                            Surprise, surprise they're gone
                            Full moon, your time goes by
                            A new moon's still kept out of sight

                            (We live)
                            Misty tales and poems lost
                            (We die)
                            All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                            May my weary soul find release for a while
                            At the moment of death I will smile
                            It's the triumph of shame and disease
                            In the end
                            Iliad

                            Raise my hands and praise the day
                            Break the spell, show me the way
                            In decay
                            The flame of Troy will shine bright

                            Roam in darkness
                            Spread the vision
                            We will be lost if you truly believe

                            Troy in darkness
                            There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
                            That they've gone away
                            And won't come back

                            They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
                            They'll truly believe in the lie
                            Lie, lie
                            With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe

                            The vision's so clear
                            When day and dream unite
                            The end is near
                            You'd better be prepared

                            The nightmare shall be over now
                            There's nothing more to fear
                            Come join in our singing and dance with us now
                            The nightmare shall be over now
                            There's nothing more to fear
                            The war, it is over, forevermore

                            No hope, the blind leads the blind
                            Carry on, though future's denied
                            Mare or stallion, there's far more inside
                            We're in at the kill
                            We'll cheerfully die

                            Misty tales and poems lost
                            All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                            May my weary soul find release for a while
                            At the moment of death I will smile
                            It's the triumph of shame and disease
                            In the end
                            Iliad

                            Raise my hands and praise the day
                            Break the spell, show me the way
                            In decay
                            The flame of Troy will shine bright

                            Holy light shines on

                            So the judgement's been made
                            We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
                            The crack of doom
                            Father, your handsome son is heading home

                            Still the wind blows
                            Calm and silent
                            Carries news from a distant shore
                            (Heading home)
                            (repeat 2x)

                            Out of mind
                            Can't get it
                            Can't get it out of my head
                            Sorrow and defeat
                            Sorrow and defeat
